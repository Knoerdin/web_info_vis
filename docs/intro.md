# Introduction

In today’s civilization, cars are by far the main mode of transportation, in the US 87% of all travel is done by car. With the immense amount of travel in motor vehicles, accidents are bound to happen. Naturally, these accidents have a plethora of different reasons for happening, some, like drunk driving or sub-par roads can be avoided. Others, like weather; the main subject of this datastory, are out of our control. Whether it’s thunderstorms or icy roads, humanity is unable to outright stop certain weather from happening, but are these unavoidable weather phenomena really a primary cause for vehicle accidents?

This datastory compares three datasets about weather and driving to find out if the weather truly has a great impact on vehicle accidents, or if the weather is merely a minor variable when it comes to causing accidents.
