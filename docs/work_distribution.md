# Work distribution
Our workflow consisted mainly of seminars, and often also booking rooms to work in after these seminars. We frequently bounced ideas off of each other and provided each other with valuable feedback. Individually our work was divided as follows.

Nordin: Mainly took lead of the group and the vision of the final product. Created multiple plots, and was responsible for the creation of the website.

Lennart: Created most of the latter graphs and plots, and worked a lot on aggregating, cleaning and joining the datasets. Also found and worked with the third dataset about driver error.

Gijs: Created the map plot and the severity plot, brainstormed initial ideas, and supported all other group members with their endeavors. Also helped with aggregating and cleaning the datasets.

Finn: Mainly in charge of writing main datastory components, such as the intro and conclusion. Also contributed some code to certain visualizations.
